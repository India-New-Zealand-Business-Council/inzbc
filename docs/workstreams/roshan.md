# Worklog — Roshan

Role: intelligence, sources, data, FTA. Writes data into the system through the shared API. No UI.
Ordered backlog; take the top **Next up** item. Move finished items to **Done**.

## Lanes (my paths)
```
/apps/fta/**
/apps/comms/**        (service side; Paras owns the UI side)
/apps/sip/pipeline/**
/apps/sip/collector/** (integration with the daily-india-nz-news-agent repo)
```
Cross-repo: the collection engine lives in `daily-india-nz-news-agent`. Improve it there via its
own PR flow; this lane is the integration that pulls its output into SIP.

## Modules I own (see [docs/modules](../modules/README.md))
[SIP pipeline](../sip/) (collection, sources, candidates, verification) +
[FTA Implementation Centre](../modules/fta-centre.md) + Explainer service +
[Communications Assistant](../modules/comms-assistant.md) service side (Paras owns its UI).

## Depends on (Bhanu's contracts)
DB schema, API contract, auth. Build against them; don't write to control-plane tables.

## Next up
- [ ] Source register + per-source outcomes (Included/Context/Suppressed/Inaccessible/Excluded/No Qualifying Item) with fallback attempts recorded.
- [ ] Candidate capture: all fields (relevance, signal, confidence, verification, duplicate status, routing).
- [ ] Verification/citation controls: High/Critical claims need an official/high-confidence source; block unverified Critical.
- [ ] FTA source corpus (Tier 1 official first) + freshness/effective-date tracking.
- [ ] FTA Explainer service: sector query to sourced answer with citation + effective date + next step.

## Done
- [x] Wire the collection-engine output into SIP candidate capture via the API (run to
  candidates). `apps/sip/collector/mapping.py` + `ingest.py`, mapped against the real
  `daily-india-nz-news-agent` `clean_articles()` output. Raw capture only (SIP-184 step 5); no
  live run yet — see blockers below.

## Blocked / decisions needed
- FTA sectors in scope + disclaimer wording (INZBC to confirm).
- Collection-engine secrets in the org repo (needs the values) — blocks running the collector
  end-to-end even though the mapping is written.
- `source_library` name lookup: candidates currently write with `source_id=None` because
  `schemas/api-contract.md` has no endpoint to resolve the agent's free-text source name to a
  DB id. Needs a contract change from Bhanu (`GET /api/source-library` or similar).

## Definition of done
A run opens, sources are recorded with outcomes, candidates captured and verified, and written to
the DB through the API. FTA answers cite Tier-1 sources with effective dates. No control-plane writes.

Base: main @ <short-sha> — record when you start a task; rebase if behind.
